# KIV_PRO_clustering
Code created for the 2nd semester thesis from the subject KIV/PRO.
The main executable script is `semestral_work_02.py`. It needs `clustering.py` and `xypoint.py` in the same folder to run.
## Notes
- I declare that the code from this repository was made by myself and is my work.
- As the author of the code, I ask you to only be inspired by it, not to use my code in its original form without my permission (the code is provided with an MIT license).
- Algorithms themselves are relatively optimal in terms of runtime, other operations like measurement etc. not anymore, due to my free time available for implementation. However, this does not change their correctness in terms of results.
- Thanks to versioning on GitHub, the original commit date of my code can be traced (in case someone feels that this is plagiarism)
